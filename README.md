## Overview

Liquid Glass Compose is a powerful library designed for Jetpack Compose, focusing on the trendy glassmorphism design style. This library utilizes AGSL shaders, available for Android 13 and above, to create stunning visual effects. With support for blur, distortion, shadows, and more, you can easily enhance your app's user interface.

### Features

- **Blur Effects**: Add depth to your UI by incorporating soft blur effects.
- **Distortion**: Create unique visual experiences with distortion effects.
- **Shadows**: Enhance your components with realistic shadows.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the effects to fit your app's theme and design.

## Getting Started

To start using Liquid Glass Compose, you need to add the library to your project. Follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later)
- Jetpack Compose
- Android 13 or higher

### Installation

Add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.andrea60727:liquid-glass-compose:1.0.0'
}
```

### Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the Liquid Glass library in your Jetpack Compose application:

```kotlin
import com.andrea60727.liquidglasscompose.*

@Composable
fun GlassCard() {
    GlassCard(
        modifier = Modifier
            .fillMaxWidth()
            .height(200.dp)
            .padding(16.dp),
        blurRadius = 10.dp,
        shadowColor = Color.Black.copy(alpha = 0.3f)
    ) {
        Text("Hello, Glassmorphism!", style = MaterialTheme.typography.h6)
    }
}
```

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced usage, you can customize the properties of the glass effects:

```kotlin
GlassCard(
    modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
    blurRadius = 15.dp,
    distortionAmount = 5.dp,
    shadowColor = Color.Gray.copy(alpha = 0.5f)
) {
    // Your content here
